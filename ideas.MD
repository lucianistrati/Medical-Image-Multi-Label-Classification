# TODO try to train in a multi-labels classif way with keras, or pytorch if not possible with keras, perhaps it
# will learn better in this multimodal format (since the classification might be related one with another
# oooor, maybe do: first classification, then use that prediction for the second classification and then use the
# first and the third to also produce the fourth
